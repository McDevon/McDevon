### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This profile contains hobby projects and learning exercises.

Most active is the Taxman game engine project, which I work on in order to
- Learn new things, such as [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) in browser and in the backend
- Try out new tech, such as [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion) AI image generation for game assets
- Build my own engine to use in game jams
- Complete the kind of game that I would like to play myself (working title is "The Cursed Taxman")
- Practice optimisation techniques to make cool effects run on the [Playdate](https://play.date) console

During office hours I work as an IT consultant focusing on
- ðŸ“± Mobile development
- ðŸŽ® Game services
- ðŸ§  Development processes
- ðŸ‘‚ Communication
